  <section id="tree-structure">
    <h2>Tree Structure</h2>
    <p>A tree's structure includes key elements like the trunk, branches, and crown, all of which support growth and stability. Arborists focus on maintaing this structure to ensure the tree's health and balance.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trunk:</strong> The central support, transporting water and nutrients between roots and leaves.</li>
      <li><strong>Branches:</strong> Extend from the trunk, supporting the crown and carrying leaves and, sometimes, fruit.</li>
      <li><strong>Crown:</strong> The upper part of the tree where branches and leaves form, supporting photosynthesis and growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Leader:</strong> The main vertical stem, which helps define the tree's shape and height.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="roots">
    <h2>Tree Roots</h2>
    <p>Roots anchor the tree and absorb water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Taproots:</strong> Deep, central roots that anchor the tree and reach water reserves.</li>
      <li><strong>Lateral Roots:</strong> Spread horizontally, stabilizing the tree and absorbing surface nutrients.</li>
      <li><strong>Fibrous Roots:</strong> A network of thin roots near the soil surface that absorb water and minerals quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Root Growth and Environmental Factors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Water Availability</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Roots grow deeper and spread wider when water is scarce, seeking out new sources.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Soil Type</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Sandy soil: Easy for roots to spread, but it drains water quickly.</li>
          <li>Clay soil: Retains water well, but can be harder for roots to penetrate.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Oxygen Levels</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Roots need oxygen for respiration; compacted soil limits oxygen availability, hindering growth.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="trunk">
    <h2>Tree Trunk</h2>
    <p>The trunk supports the branches and transports the nutrients between the roots and the leaves.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bark:</strong> The tough, protective outer layer that guards against pests and physical damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Cambium:</strong> A thin layer of cells responsible for growth in the tree's diameter.</li>
      <li><strong>Sapwood:</strong> The living wood layer that transports water and nutrients throughout the tree.</li>
      <li><strong>Heartwood:</strong> The strong, central core that provides stability and support, though it no longer actively transports nutrients.</li>
      <li><strong>Xylem:</strong>  Tubes that carry water from the roots to the leaves, crucial for hydration and nutrient delivery.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="growth-rings">
    <h2>Growth Rings</h2>
    <p>Each year, trees form a new growth ring as they grow. These rings reveal the trees age and offer clues about past environmental conditions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Growth rings develop each growing season. Wider rings indicate favorable conditions, while narrower rings can show signs of stress.</li>
      <li><strong>Dendrochronology:</strong> The study of growth rings to understand a tree's life history and climate changes over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Tree Age:</strong> By counting the rings, we can determine the age of the tree, giving insights into its maturity and resilience.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="defenses">
    <h2>Tree Defenses</h2>
    <p>Trees have built-in defense systems to protect against pests, diseases, and physical damage. Understanding these helps arborists provide better care when injuries occur.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chemical Defenses:</strong> Tree produce compounds like tannins to deter insects and pathogens.</li>
      <li><strong>Compartmentalization:</strong> Trees isolate damaged tissue to contain decay and prevent it from spreading.</li>
      <li><strong>Wound Response:</strong> Instead of healing, trees cover wounds to protect exposed tissue and minimize infection risks.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="pruning">
    <h2>Pruning Basics</h2>
    <p>Pruning helps trees maintain healthy structure, improve growth, and remove damaged or diseased branches. Each cut type has a specfic purpose.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thinning Cut:</strong> Removes a branch at its origin, improving airflow and light distribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Heading Cut:</strong> Shortens a branch to a bud, encouraging new, denser growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Removal Cut:</strong> Completely removes a branch to eliminate dead or infected wood.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="pests-diseases">
    <h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
    <p>Trees are vulnerable to various pests and diseases that can affect their health, growth, and lifespan. Arborists play a key role in identifying and managing these threats.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Sap feeding insects that cause leaf discoloration and weaken the tree.</li>
      <li><strong>Emerald Ash Borer:</strong> A destructive beetle that feeds on ash trees' inner bark, often leading to tree death.</li>
      <li><strong>Dutch Elm Disease:</strong> A fungal infection that disruptswater movement in elms, causing wilting and dieback.</li>
      <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungus that coats leaves in a white powder, impacting photosynthesis and overall health.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="soil-roots">
    <h2>Soil and Roots</h2>
    <p>Healthy soil and root systems are essential for tree growth, stability, and overall health. Arborists focus on maintaining soil quality and root health to support trees.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Roots as Anchors:</strong> Roots stabilize the tree, helping it stand firm during strong winds.</li>
      <li><strong>Water and Nutrient Absoprtion:</strong> Roots absorb essential water and nutrients that support growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Drainage</strong> Well-draining soil prevents root rot by allowing excess water to flow away from the roots.</li>
      <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Soil:</strong> Trees need balanced nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for healthy growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Soil pH:</strong> Most trees prefer a slightly acidic to neutral pH for optimal nutrient absorption.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="photosynthesis">
    <h2>Photosynthesis</h2>
    <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which trees produce energy. Using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, they create food and fuels growth and repair, while releasing oxygen as a byproduct.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Absorbed by leaves, it provides the energy needed for photosynthesis.</li>
      <li><strong>Water:</strong> taken up from the roots and transported to the leaves, where it helps produce ebergy.</li>
      <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide:</strong> Trees absorb CO<sub>2</sub> from the air, using it to produce energy and release oxygen.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="tree-stressors">
    <h2>Tree Response to Environmental Stressors</h2>
    <p>Trees encounter various stressors, like drought, nutrient deficiency, and pests, that can impact their health.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drought:</strong> Trees may drop leaves to reduce water loss, slow growth, or go dormant during severe droughts.</li>
      <li><strong>Nutrient Deficiency:</strong> Trees adjust root growth to reach nutrients and may store them more efficiently to support survival.</li>
      <li><strong>Insect Infestation:</strong> Trees produce chemicals to defend themselves against pests or grow thicker bark as a physical barrier.</li>
      <li><strong>Poor Soil:</strong> Trees develop extensive root systems to reach water and nutrients in challenging soil conditions.</li>
      
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="tree-pruning">
    <h2>Tree Pruning Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>Pruning is an essential treee caer technique that promotes health, safety, and structural integrity. Arborists prune to remove dead or damaged branches, improve tree shape, and prevent potential hazards.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Health:</strong> Pruning removes dead, diseased, or damaged branches, reducing decay and promoting growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Pruning reduces the risk of falling branches and keeps growth away from hazards like power lines.</li>
      <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Pruning shapes the tree to ensure balanced growth and prevent structural issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Prune during the dormant season (often late winter) to minimize stress on the tree.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="tree-fertilization">

        <p>The stem or trunk supports the tree's structure and transports water, nutrients, and sugars between roots and leaves. Damage to a tree's stem can disrupt these processes, leading to a weakened tree. Arborists monitor the stem for injuries, cracks, or decay to ensure the tree remains healthy and strong.</p>

    <h2>Tree Growth Processes</h2>

    <!-- Growth Patterns Section -->
    <div class="growth-section">
      <h3>1. Growth Patterns</h3>
      <button class="toggle-button">Read More</button>
      <p class="details" style="display: none;">Trees exhibit unique growth patterns, primarily driven by two types of growth: primary growth (lengthening) and secondary growth (widening). Primary gowth occurs at the tips of the roots and shoots, extending the tree's reach for sunlight, water, and nutrients. This process is enabled by meristem cells in these areas, which actively divide and create new cells that elongate the plant body. Over time, this extension not only supports the tree's upward growth but also improve's access to resources necessary for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Meanwhile, secondary growth takes place in the vascular cambium, a thin layer of cells between the bark and wood. This type of growth produces xylem (wood) and phloem (bark) cells, which thicken the trunk and branches, allowing the tree to support greater height and canopy spread.</p>
    </div>
    

    <!-- Vascular Tissues Section -->
    <div class="growth-section">
      <h3>2. Vascular Tissues</h3>
      <button class="toggle-button">Read More</button>
      <p class="details" style="display: none;">Trees depend on vascular tissues to transport essential water, nutrients, and sugars throughout their structure. The xylem is responsible for moving water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, where photosynthesis occurs. Through a process known as transpiration, water evaopration from the leaf surface, creating a pull that draws more water upward through the xylem. In contrast, the phloem sugars  and organic compunds created during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the tree. This transportation system is essential for sustaining growth, repairing damage, and supprting energy intensive reproduction processes like flowering and seed production. Together, these processes allow trees to adapt and thrive in their environment, responding to chnages in sunlight, water availability, and temperature iver their lifespan.</p>

    <!-- Compartmentilization Section-->
    <div class="growth-section">
      <h3>3. Compartmentalization</h3>
      <button class="toggle-button">Read More</button>
      <p class="details" style="display: none;">Trees undergo a fascinating form of compartmentalization, a natural process of isolating damaged or infected areas to prevent the spread of decay. When a tree experiences injury, such as a broken limb or fungal infection, it responds by creating chemical and physical barriers around the affected area. These barriers consist of specialized cells and compounds that limit the spread of pathogens and rot. This process is especially important in older larger trees, where damged areas could otherwise compromise structural integrity. Understanding compartmnetalization helps arborists assess tree health, make informed pruning decisions, and recommend treatments that align with the tree's natural healing mechanisms. By respecting these internal processes, arborists can work with a tree's biology to encourage stronger, healthier growth.</p>

  <section id="leaves">
    <h2>Leaves</h2>
    <p>Leaves are responsible for photosynthesis, converting sunlight into energy for the tree.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> A process where leaves use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen, providing energy for the tree.</li>
      <li><strong>Clorophyll:</strong> The green pigment in leaves that capture sunlight, essential for photosynthesis.</li>
      <li><strong>Stomata:</strong> Small pores on the leaf surface that control gas exchange, allowing carbon dioxide in and oxygen out.</li>
      <li><strong>Transpiration:</strong> The process of water evaporating from the leaves, which pullswater up through the xylem from the roots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tree Responses to Environmental Stressors</h2>

    <!-- Water Availability -->
    <div>
      <h3>1. Water Availability</h3>
      <button class="toggle-button">Read More</button>
      <p class="details" style="display: none">Tree are exposed to various environmental stressors that influnce their health, growth and longevity. One of the most significatn stressors is water availability. When faced with drought conditions, trees respond by closing the stomata on their leabes to reduce water loss through transpiration. This closure, while conserving water , limits photosynthesis since less carbon dioxide enters the leave. Some tree species also develop deeper root systems in response to repeated drought, allowing them to access water reserves in the soil. Conversely, during excessive rain or flooding, trees can suffer from oxygen depletion in the root zone, which impairs root function and can lead to root rot.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Temperture Extremes -->
    <div>
      <h3>2. Temperature Extremes</h3>
      <button class="toggle-button">Read More</button>
      <p class="details" style="display: none;">Trees also respond to temperature extremes. In cold climates, deciduous trees drop their leaves in winter to conserve energy and reduce the risk of frost damage to delicate leaf tissues. During extreme heat, trees face challenges like dehydration and heat stress, leading to leaf scorch or browning. Some trees exhibit adaptive mechanisms such as sunken stomata or waxy coatings on leaves to minimize water loss and protect against intense sunlight. In urban environments, where temperatures can be significantly higher than rural areas due to the urban heat island effect, heat resistant species or cultivars are often chosen for planting to ensure better survival and growth.</p>
    </div>

    <!--  Biotic Stressors -->

    <div>
      <h3>3. Biotic Stressors</h3>
      <button class="toggle-button">Read More</button>
      <p class="details" style="display: none;">Trees must also contend with biotic stressors, such as pests and diseases. In response to an insect attack, trees often release volatile organic compounds that attract natural predators of the attacking pest, creating a defense mechanism that reduces damage. For instance, a tree under attack by caterpillars  may release chemicals that attract parasitic wasps which lay eggs on the caterpillars. Trees also compartmentalize infections caused by fungi or bacteria, isolating the infected tissues to prevent the spread of pathogens. Understanding these responses allows arborists to identify stress symptoms early and recommend treatments that support the trees natural defense systems, such as selective pruning to remove branches or recommending watering strategies that mitigate drought stress.</p>
